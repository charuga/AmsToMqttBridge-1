# AmsToMqttBridge

These files are based on a fork from the late Roar Fredriksens code for the AMS to MQTT Bridge he created.
The code is modified to handle Aidon meters without the HAN port enabled, but outputting data that are readable and convertable for bridging to an MQTT server.

All information on the hardware and original software may be found in roarfred GitHub repository here:

This code is Arduino code downloadable throug the serial connection on the board
